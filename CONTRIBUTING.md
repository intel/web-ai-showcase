# Contributing

We encourage public contributions! Actually without tremendous great efforts from projects like ONNX Runtime, Transformers.js, TensorFlow.js, MediaPipe, TVM and so on, we couldn't be here with so many great demos.

Especially we want to thank Joshua Lochner, author of Transformers.js, for his full permission to freely use his images, videos and demos related to Transformers.js project. Please connect the related great stuff to his contributions to this project.

## How to contribute

We welcome contributions to Web-AI-Showcase. You can:

- Log a bug or provide feedback with an [issue].
- Submit your changes directly with a [pull request].

### Pull requests

This project follows a simple workflow with contributions delivered as PRs against the main branch.
To submit your change:

- Make sure your code is in line with our coding conventions by running `npm run lint` to format the
  code.
- Create an [issue] describing the bug the PR fixes or the feature you intend to implement.
- Submit a [pull request] into the main branch.

Your PR will then be reviewed by one or more maintainers. Your PR will be automatically merged
(assuming no conflicts) with one approving review. Maintainers may suggest changes to a PR before
approving.

### Sign your work

Please use the sign-off line at the end of the patch. Your signature certifies that you wrote the patch or otherwise have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch. The rules are pretty simple: if you can certify
