                3.1 Proprietary Rights. To the extent not infringing GitHub’s
                due rights in enabling Intel to deploy this Service through

                property rights related to the website and the Services,
                including all improvements to the Services. All materials that
                Intel produce, including the website, design, code, graphics,
                interfaces, trademarks, and logo shall remain our exclusive
                property. You may not alter, reproduce, republish, license any
                of our proprietary materials, unless Intel expressly give You a
                written permission to do so. All rights not expressly granted
                are reserved and retained by Intel.

            <div>
              <p>
                3.2 Nothing in these Terms is intended to limit Intel’s use of
                our knowledge, skills, experience, ideas, concepts, know-how
                and/or techniques developed or learned at any time, without
                limitation. If You provide Intel feedback regarding the use,
                operation, performance, or functionality of our website,
                Services, or business (collectively, "Feedback"), You hereby
                grant Intel a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free,
                and non-exclusive right and license to exploit and commercialize
                the Feedback, improve the Services, and develop and/or
                commercialize new offerings, which Intel will solely and
                exclusively own. In addition, and subject to our Privacy Policy,
                Intel may aggregate, anonymize, or otherwise learn from data
                relating to your use of the Services, and use the foregoing to
                improve those Services.

                3.3 Open Source. Certain items provided with the Services may be
                subject to "open source" or "creative commons" or other similar
                licenses (collectively, "Open Source"). The Open-Source license
                terms are not intended to be replaced or overridden by the
                license and other terms of these Terms; however, the limitations
                of liabilities, disclaimers, and this provision apply to any
                such Open Source. Nothing in these Terms limit your rights
                under, or grants you rights that supersede, the terms and
                conditions of any applicable Open-Source license. If Intel (or
                You) make modifications to Open Source, and if the applicable
                Open Source requires that such modifications be made available,
                and Intel (or You) do not already publish such modifications via
                the applicable open-source community, then modifications will be
                available on applicable websites.
